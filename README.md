# Nebulei

Nebulei is a  Social-Network for intellectuals to engage/debate large topics about Science,
Technology, Philosophy and Engineering while making large progress of creation, 
discovery, invention, and most importantly; allowing collaboration to take place 
as we believe there is a lack of shared work among intellectuals of the world.

> **We are working hard on Nebulei's first version. If you are new to Nebulei, try experimenting on new features with us.**

## Contributing

We are creating Nebulei because we want to scale humanities knowledge in all different subjects by letting intellectuals have the oppurtunity to collaborate. We hope that humans no matter what occupation can help progress this project in letting people with a certain skillset have a voice in implementing new features. We are thankful for any contributions from the community.
